# notwashingtonpost
Loose clone of the WaPo website built in React / WebPack. A [preview](http://jspenkar.com/notwashingtonpost/) is available.

The site loosely follows the look and feel of the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/) and [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) website. 

##Instruction:
1) run `git clone https://github.com/penkar/notwashingtonpost.git` to clone the repository.
2) run `cd notwashinttonpost`
3) run `npm install`
4) run `npm dev` to see a local version on localhost:8000 .

All the articles are currently composed of Lorem Ipsum text and titled with random literary techniques. You can navigate between sections, however since the number of articles is limited, they are all classified as either Politics or Opinion.

The still unimplemented portion includes setting up some remote JSON based database / server for the UI to connect to with further articles. Hopefully articles that carry content above lorem ipsum.
